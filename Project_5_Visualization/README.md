# Project: Prosper loan dataset Analysis and Visualization
## Introduction of the data
> **This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.**

###  Objectives of the analysis
> So far we were able to look at the structure of our data and we found out it had 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, which inludes variables like loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income etc.

>I will be very much concise on figuring the factors that predicts loan outcome in the dataset for simplicity. So i will be working with a few variable that helps me do that.

**Features that will aid my analysis**
- i think features like `background of the borrower, occupation, employment status, income rating and verifiability , whether he is homeowner or not and prosper rating` will have a huge impact on loan outcome status so will be focusing on these columns more

## Summary and Insights
- majority of the employed borrowers earned between 50K - 74,999K USD
- For browwers with prosper ratings from AA to B have the higher loan amount with increased salary
- The distribution of monthly income of applicants is a right skewed because there will be few applicants with high salary.
- being employed and owning a home increases your chances of getting a large loan amount
- We observe that applicants with high rating tends to have a low interest rate wether that person owns a home or not. as your rating decrease, your interest rate increase
