# udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Project Overview
<h2> project 1: Global Temperature VS Abuja Temperature Analysis over 10 years
year’s intervals  </h2>

> <p>The goal of this analysis is to find out if Abuja is hotter compared to the rest of
this world and also determine if temperature has increased or decreased over
the years</p>

<h2>project 2: Investigate a Medical Dataset (To determine the characteristics behind a patient showing or not showing for a scheduled appointment) </h2>

><p>Main: What are the characteristics that surrounds if a patient show up for appointment or not</p>

<h2>project3: Analyze A/B Test Results</h2>

><p>A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these</p>

> <p>For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.</p>

<h2>project4: Wrangle and Analyze Data</h2>

> <p>Introduction This project focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, documented in a Jupyter Notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb). This Twitter account rates dogs with humorous commentary. The rating denominator is usually 10, however, the numerators are usually greater than 10. They’re Good Dogs Brent wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.</p>

> <p>WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.</p>

> <p>The goal of this project is to wrangle the WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The challenge lies in the fact that the Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information that comes in JSON format. I needed to gather, asses and clean the Twitter data for a worthy analysis and visualization<p>

<h2>project5: Investigate Prosper loan dataset and find What factors affect a loan’s outcome status etc</h2>

> <p>I will be very much concise on figuring the factors that predicts loan outcome in the dataset for simplicity. So i will be working with a few variable that helps me do that.</p>
